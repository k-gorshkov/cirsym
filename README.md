Cirsym â€“ symbolic circuit analysis program that provides generation of symbolic function in the form of a ratio of two nested expressions for any lumped, linear, time-invariant circuit. All circuit parameters have been presented in a symbolic form. A computational complexity of expressions is minimized to achieve the optimal number of operations and characters. The input data is a slightly modified Spice-compatible netlist, which can be entered online or loaded as a cir-file.
